      Hi, Guest:
      <p>
        Welcome to my Math Magician Web App. Here I have made it using React,
        bootStrap, React Icons, CSS and React Router Dom.
        Here you can do basic calculations by going to calculator tab from the menu.
        You can also view a random quote by going to the quote tab from the menu.
      </p>
    </pre>
  );
};

export default Home;
